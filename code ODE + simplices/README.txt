The core library presented here can handle the following cases:
- ODEs:
    - polynomial vector fields
    - computation of single orbit, branch, or 2D-manifold
    - validation of single orbit, branch, or 2D-manifold
    - automatic blow up for the computation of a Hopf bifurcation
    - saddle node validation w.r.t. any variable
    - Hopf bifurcation validation (with blow up approach)
