bubbles

this is a share project between Dr. K. Church and Dr. E. Queirolo on validating endemic bubbles.
Endemic bubbles are codimesion 2 bifurcations. On one side of the bifurcation, there is just the branch of stationary points, while on the other the branch undergoes two Hopf bifurcations, one creating a periodic orbit, the other eating the periodic orbit up.
The initial goal is to validate a full bubble, that is all the periodic orbits between two Hopf bifurcations as a single object.

Code: old code involving 2D Fourier series is uploaded for use. The code base will be in Matlab
